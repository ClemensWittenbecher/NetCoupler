Description: The NetCoupler algorithm identifies direct effects
    of correlated, high-dimensional exposures on time-to-event data. It
    can also be used with an external exposure that may effect the -omic
    network (e.g. lifestyle), to be used to identify indirect pathways
    between the external exposure and an outcome.
