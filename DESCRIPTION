Description: The NetCoupler algorithm identifies direct effects of correlated, 
    high-dimensional exposures on time-to-event data. It can also be used with
    an external exposure that may effect the -omic network (e.g. lifestyle), to
    be used to identify indirect pathways between the external exposure and an 
    outcome.
